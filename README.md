# Yarely Benchmarking

This repository provides a collection of scripts to conduct performance benchmarks of the [Yarely signage player](https://github.com/opendisplays/yarely). Please use the [benchmarking branch of Yarely](https://github.com/opendisplays/yarely/tree/benchmarking) that consists of specific logging output in order to conduct performance benchmarks.

## Getting Started

To run the benchmarks, please follow these steps:

* Install Yarely from its [benchmarking branch](https://github.com/opendisplays/yarely/tree/benchmarking)
* Configure the paths in `run_benchmarks.py` to point at the approrpiate Yarely project directory (`YARELY_PROJ_DIR`), log directory used to monitor the number of iterations (`YARELY_LOG_DIR` and `BENCHMAKR_LOG_PATH`), and the path to the Content Descriptor Set that is dynamically generated by the benchmark script for each iteration (`YARELY_CDS_PATH`). 
* Use `generate_images.py` to generate a set of random images. 
* Set the path to the randomy generated images in `run_benchmarks.py` accordingly (`IMAGES_PATH`).
* Optional: Use `rename_images_to_hash.py` to prefill Yarely's cache by copying the hashed images into Yarely's cache directory.

The benchmarking scriopt allows a range of configuration parameters: 

* Intervals (i.e. range of number of content items): `BENCHMARK_INTERVALS`.
* Number of iterations per interval: `DEFAULT_ITERATIONS`.
